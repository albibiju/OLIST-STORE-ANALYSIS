# Olist Store Analysis

## **Project Overview**  
The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize customer purchasing patterns and payment statistics on the Olist eCommerce platform to derive meaningful insights. The dataset consists of nine CSV files containing information such as order timestamps, payment details, delivery timelines, and customer reviews. Through this analysis, the project aims to identify key trends in consumer behavior, payment preferences, and service efficiency. It also explores the relationship between factors like delivery time, review scores, and sales distribution across different time periods. The insights gained from this study are presented using interactive dashboards for easy interpretation and decision-making.

I developed this project individually using Excel, Power BI, and Tableau. Excel was utilized for data cleaning and transformation, Power BI helped in constructing the data model and calculating KPIs, while Tableau was used to create visually engaging dashboards. This project showcases my ability to work with large datasets, derive actionable insights, and effectively communicate findings through data visualization tools.

## **Key Insights**  
- **Weekday vs Weekend Sales:** Analyzed customer purchase patterns based on order timestamps to identify peak sales periods.  
- **Payment Type & Review Score:** Examined the correlation between high review scores (5-star ratings) and payment methods, particularly credit card usage.  
- **Delivery Time Analysis:** Measured average delivery times for specific categories (e.g., pet shops) to identify efficiency gaps.  
- **Regional Spending Patterns:** Investigated average purchase price and payment values of customers in SÃ£o Paulo to uncover high-value customer segments.  
- **Shipping Time vs Customer Satisfaction:** Explored how variations in shipping duration impacted customer review scores, helping to optimize logistics.  

## **Conclusion**  
This project successfully uncovered key insights about customer preferences, payment behaviors, and service performance on the Olist platform. By leveraging Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, I demonstrated my ability to clean and analyze complex datasets, extract key business metrics, and develop interactive dashboards for decision-making. The findings from this analysis can help Olist optimize its marketing strategies, improve delivery efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction.
